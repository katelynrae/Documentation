## Which application do I need?
**Network Canvas** runs Network Canvas protocols and collects data. It is the
application that an interviewer would use when in the field.

**Architect** is the program for creating Network Canvas protocols.

**Server** is the program that sends protocols to Network Canvas and receives
data back from the field. Please note that you can also download protocols
directly into Network Canvas. The function of server is to manage a project
with many cases across devices.

Each application can be downloaded and installed individually. Architect and
Server are desktop applications. Network Canvas can run on a desktop but it
is also designed for tablet devices.

## Installation for Windows

Visit the [download page](https://networkcanvas.com/download.html), and download the Windows version of each app you require.

Open each .exe file. You may be presented with a dialog that says the application
cannot be run because it is from an unsigned publisher. This happens because
our apps have not yet built up enough trust with Microsoft to automatically pass these filters. This will change as more users install our apps.

In order to continue to install the application simply click the "more info" text in the
dialog. Then a "Run Anyway" button should appear. Once the application is
installed it should open straight away. You should also be able to find the
application in your program list from the start menu.

## Installation for macOS
Visit the [download page](https://networkcanvas.com/download.html), and download the macOS version of each app you require. These are packaged in the form of a DMG disk archive.

When you double-click on the file it will open a new Finder window with the
application icon and a folder representing your computer's "Applications"
folder. Drag each application into the Applications folder. If you are prompted for
authentication and you do not have it, you can simply drag the application to
anywhere underneath your home directory.

Once the application is installed you will need to double click on the
application icon to open the program.

## Notes on installation for Linux

Network Canvas uses both the Snappy and App Image universal installation
package formats for distributing Linux packages.

### App Image

Visit the [download page](https://networkcanvas.com/download.html), and download the AppImage version of each app you require.

Once downloaded, installation should be as simple as making the .AppImage file
executable, and then double clicking it. You should then be prompted to
integrate the package with your system.

### SNAP

Visit the [download page](https://networkcanvas.com/download.html), and download the SNAP version of each app you require.

The latest beta versions of the suite will soon be made available through the Snapcraft
Store by searching for the names of the apps. For the time being these versions
may not be fully functional. In particular, functions that require network or
device access may not work correctly, or at all.

## Notes on installation for Android

Installation for Android devices works the same as with any other Android app.
It can be found by opening the Play Store app, and searching for "Network Canvas".
Alternatively, you can visit the Play Store website, and initialize the
installation on your devices from there:

### [Visit the Google Play Store listing for Network Canvas](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.codaco.networkCanvas)

Please note that Network Canvas requires Android version 7.1 or newer, and
will work best with larger tablet devices (9.7"+). Installation is restricted to devices
that meet these criteria.

If you cannot find Network Canvas in the Play Store, it is likely because your
device is not compatible. If you believe your device should be compatible and
you still cannot find the app in the Play Store, please contact us.

## Notes on installation for ChromeOS

If your ChromeOS device supports installing Android apps, you can install the
Network Canvas app as usual through the Google Play Store. To do this, please
see the instructions above for installing the app on Android.

Please note that only Network Canvas is specifically designed to work with
ChromeOS. Running Architect or Server (for example through Linux app
compatibility) is not supported at present.

## Notes on installation for iOS

Network Canvas Beta can be installed directly from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/network-canvas/id1233134698) on any device running iOS. 

Once you have completed this, you can click on the following link to join the
testing program: [Network Canvas on Apple TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/xHonPrKO).

Network Canvas was developed on a 12.9" iPad pro, and will work best with
larger iOS devices (9.7"+). A version of iOS greater than 10 is required to
install and use the software.
